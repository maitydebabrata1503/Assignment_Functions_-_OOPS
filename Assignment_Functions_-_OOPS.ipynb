    "By convention, attributes and methods intended to be private (not accessed outside the class) are prefixed with an underscore '_' (single \n",

    "1. Accessing \"Protected\" Attributes and Methods:\n",

    "#71. How does encapsulation relate to property decorators in Python? Provide an example showcasing encapsulation using property decorators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is a key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate\n",
